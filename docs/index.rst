Welcome to Eve-Mongoengine
==========================

Eve-Mongoengine is and Eve extension, which enables Mongoengine ODM models
to be used as eve schema. If you use mongoengine in your application and
simultaneously want to use eve, instead of writing schema again in cerberus
format, you can use this extension, which takes your mongoengine models and
auto-transforms it into creberus schema.

Install
-------

Simple installation using pip::

    pip install eve-mongoengine

It loads all dependencies as well (Eve and nothing more!).

For development use virtualenv and editable copy of repisotory::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/hellerstanislav/eve-mongoengine#egg=eve-mongoengine


Usage
-----
::

    import mongoengine
    from eve import Eve
    from eve_mongoengine import EveMongoengine

    # create some dummy model class
    class Person(mongoengine.Document):
        name = mongoengine.StringField()
        age = mongoengine.IntField()

    # default eve settings
    my_settings = {
        'MONGO_HOST': 'localhost',
        'MONGO_PORT': 27017,
        'MONGO_DBNAME': 'eve_mongoengine_test'
    }

    # init application
    app = Eve(settings=my_settings)
    # init extension
    ext = EveMongoengine(app)
    # register model to eve and set further eve parameters, e.g., projections
    ext.add_model(Person, datasource={ 'projection': { 'name': 1 } })

    # let's roll
    app.run()

Or, if you are setting up your data before Eve is initialized, as is the case with application factories: 

::

    import mongoengine
    from eve import Eve
    from eve_mongoengine import EveMongoengine

    ext = EveMongoengine()
    ...
    # init application
    app = Eve(settings=my_settings)

    # init extension
    ext.init_app(app)
    ...
